Observations: 

1) Figure "Tumor Volume Changes Over Time" shows that use of Capomulin resulted in significantly lower average tumor volume. Meanwhile, Innfubinol, Ketapril yielded little difference than using a placebo.

2) Figure "Metastatic Spread Over Time" shows that use of Capomulin yielded a lower number of average metastatic sites over the course of a 45 day treatment period compared to that of Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo. 

3) Figure "Survival Rate Over Time" shows that Capomulin demonstrated the highest survival rate in mice over the course of a 45 day treatment period compared to that of Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo. 

4) Figure "Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment" shows that Capomulin was the only drug to yield a reduction in average tumor volume compared to that of Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo.

Overall, Capomulin outperformed Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo. Over 45 days, use of Capomulin was found to result in tumor volume reduction, fewer metastatic site occurences, and a higher survival rate.
